# Project Description

Create a Discord bot that provides moderation features to help manage a server effectively and efficiently. The bot will have various commands and functionalities to assist moderators in maintaining a positive and orderly community.

# Improvements Needed

1. Implement a command to mute or kick users who violate server rules
2. Add a feature to log moderation actions for transparency
3. Create a warning system to notify users of their behavior before taking action
4. Include a command to clear chat history or delete specific messages
5. Develop a feature to automatically filter out inappropriate content
